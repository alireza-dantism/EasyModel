# EasyModel

MMODELLER is one of the most widely used tools for homology or comparative modeling of three-dimensional 
protein structures. However, most users find it challenging to start with MODELLER as it is a command line based and requires knowledge of basic Python scripting to use it efficiently. In this study, a web-based interface has been designed to predict the tertiary structure of proteins based on Modeller, which does the comparative modeling automatically, and uses PHP and Python programming languages. This tool is called “EasyModel” and is available at http://bioinf.modares.ac.ir/software/easymodel/. 

**EasyModel provides a straightforward graphical interface for Modeller that can be used in only one browser.**
